                <h1>What is a game?</h1>
                <p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or
                     fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are different from
                      work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which
                       is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However,
                        the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to
                         be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games)
                      or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout
                       such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).

                    Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement
                     or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by
                      amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of
                       non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess
                        championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute
                         their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part
                          of the entertainment for children playing a game is
                           deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.
                            A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for
                             unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
                    
                    Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction
                    . Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
                     Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or
                      otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.
                    
                    Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human
                     experience and present in all cultures. The Royal Game of Ur, Senet,
                      and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.</p>

                <h2>What was the first game in history?</h2>
                <p>The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer
                     scientists began designing simple games and simulations on mainframe
                      computers, with MIT's Spacewar! in 1962 as one of the first such
                       games to be played with a video display. The early 1970s brought
                        the first consumer-ready video game hardware: the first home
                         video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first
                          arcade video games, Computer Space and Pong, the latter
                           which was later made into a home console version.
                            Numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's
                             success in both the arcade and the home by creating
                              clones of the game, causing series of boom and bust
                               cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.

                    By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced
                     the discrete transistor-transistor logic circuitry of the early hardware,
                      and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the
                       Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in a
                        golden age of arcade video games with titles such as Space Invaders
                         and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished.
                          A major crash of the United States home video game
                           market occurred in 1983 as the market was flooded
                            by too many games and the sector saw competition
                             from inexpensive personal computers and new types
                              of games being developed for them. The crash set
                               the stage for Japan's video game industry to take
                                leadership of the market, which had only suffered
                                 minor impacts from the crash. Nintendo released
                                  its Nintendo Entertainment System in
                                   the United States in 1985, helping to
                                    rebound the failing video games sector.
                                     The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s
                                      saw video games driven by improvements and
                                       standardization in personal computers, and
                                        the console war competition between Nintendo
                                         and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States. The
                                          first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s,
                                           led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.
                    
                    The early 1990s saw two major shifts in technology, the introduction of
                     optical media via CD-ROMs, and the ability to perform real-time polygonal
                      3D graphic rendering from further advancements in computer microprocessors.
                       Both aspects were readily incorporated into personal computers and creating
                        a market for graphics cards, while Sony used both in its fledgling
                         PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware
                          market while diminishing Nintendo's role. By the late 1990s, the
                           Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began
                            incorporating online elements. Microsoft entered the console
                             hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing
                              that Sony's PlayStation positioned as both a game console and
                               entertainment device would displace personal computers. While
                                Sony and Microsoft continued to develop hardware of comparable
                                 top-end console features, Nintendo opted to focus on innovative
                                  gameplay, and developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls,
                                   which helped to draw in non-traditional players and helped
                                    to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry; Nintendo
                                    
                                    followed this same model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.
                    
                    From the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift
                     of demographics as mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets
                      displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming had become
                       an increasing larger sector of the market, as well as a
                        growth in the number of players from China and other
                         areas not traditionally tied to the industry. Traditional
                          revenue models were supplanted with ongoing revenue stream
                           models such as free-to-play, freemium and subscription-based
                            games to take advantage of these shifts. As triple-A video
                             game production became more costly and risk-adverse,
                              opportunities arose for more experimental and innovative
                               independent game development grew over the 2000s and 2010s,
                                aided by the popularity of mobile and casual gaming and the
                                 ease of digital distribution. Hardware and software technology
                                  continued to drive improvement in video games, with support
                                   for high-definition video at high framerates, and for virtual
                                    and augmented reality-based games.</p>

                <h3>what was the the first outdoor game?</h3>
                <p>The National Hockey League (NHL) first held a regular season outdoor ice
                     hockey game in 2003, and since 2008 the league has scheduled at least one per year.

                    The NHL primarily uses three brands for outdoor games: the Heritage Classic,
                     Winter Classic, and Stadium Series. The 2003 Heritage Classic between the
                      Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens was the first outdoor regular
                       season game in NHL history. The Heritage Classic has since been held
                        infrequently, featuring match-ups solely between Canadian teams,
                         until the Buffalo Sabres make their appearance in the 2022 Heritage
                          Classic. The annual Winter Classic, held on New Year's Day in the
                           United States, began with the 2008 game between the Pittsburgh
                           
                           Penguins and the Buffalo Sabres. The NHL then started the 
                           Stadium Series in 2014 for additional outdoor games
                           . The number of Stadium Series games has varied per
                            season (four in 2014, only one in 2015, two in 2016,
                             and one per season since 2017). Both the Winter Classic
                              and the Stadium series featured match-ups solely between
                               American teams until the Toronto Maple Leafs' appearances
                                in both the 2014 Winter Classic and the 2018 Stadium Series.
                    
                    To celebrate the NHL's 100 year anniversary in 2017, the league scheduled
                     two special outdoor games: the NHL Centennial Classic between Detroit and
                      Toronto on January 1 (through season 2016-2017) to kick off the year, and
                       then the NHL 100 Classic on December 16 (during 2017-2018 season) between
                        Montreal and the Ottawa Senators to commemorate the league's first game,
                         having taken place exactly 100 years before, between the same contenders.
                          The four teams involved in said honorific matches, alongside Boston
                           and New York, constitute the sprinkling count of the league's earliest
                            members. Then in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league held
                             the NHL Outdoors at Lake Tahoe, two outdoor games played without spectators.
                    
                    Prior to 2003, NHL teams had been involved in at least three outdoor
                     exhibitions. Two of these came in the 1950s and were effectively informal
                      scrimmages; in 1954, the Detroit Red Wings visited Marquette Branch Prison
                       and played a match against the prison inmates in a fenced-off, open air
                        ice rink, while in 1956, the Boston Bruins played a game against several
                         local teams in Bay Roberts, Newfoundland. In neither case was a formal
                          game structure maintained or score kept, as the NHL teams hopelessly
                           outmatched the hosts. In 1991, the Los Angeles Kings and New York
                            Rangers played a pre-season game outside Caesars Palace in Las
                             Vegas, in the first officially sanctioned outdoor NHL contest.
                    
                    The NHL's outdoor series have proven wildly popular with fans and have
                     led to numerous attendance records. The 2003 Heritage Classic drew 57,167
                      fans, a league record that stood until 71,217 fans in Buffalo set another
                       NHL record in the inaugural Winter Classic in 2008. The 2014 Winter Classic,
                        between Toronto and the Detroit Red Wings drew 105,491 fans, the current
                         NHL record.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <h4>who invented games?</h4>
                <p>Ralph Henry Baer (born Rudolf Heinrich Baer; March 8, 1922 0- December 6, 2014)
                     was a German-American inventor, game developer, and engineer.

                    Baer's family fled Germany just before World War II and Baer served
                     the American war effort, gaining an interest in electronics shortly
                      thereafter. Through several jobs in the electronics industry, he was
                       working as an engineer at Sanders Associates (now BAE Systems)
                        in Nashua, NH, when he conceived the idea of playing games on a
                         television screen around 1966. With support of his employers,
                          he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a
                           "Brown Box" that would later become the blueprint for the
                            first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the
                             Magnavox Odyssey. Baer continued to design several other
                              consoles and computer game units, including contributing
                               to design of the Simon electronic game. Baer continued
                                to work in electronics until his death in 2014, with over 150
                                 patents to his name.
                    
                    Baer is considered "the Father of Video Games" due to
                     his many contributions to games and helping to spark
                      the video game industry in the latter half of the
                       20th century. In February, 2006, he was awarded
                        the National Medal of Technology for "his groundbreaking
                         and pioneering creation, development and commercialization 
                         of interactive video games, which spawned related uses,
                         applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment 
                         and education realms".</p>
